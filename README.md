In this project I have built an online encyclopedia of famous figures, using all of my knowledge and skills of development. Famous Figures is a comprehensive web application that serves as a repository of notable individuals.

-- Technology Stack --
MySQL: The project utilizes MySQL as the database management system. The database was created from scratch, incorporating data collected from reliable sources on the internet. It contains over 100 famous figures, each with associated attributes such as images, descriptions, and dates of birth.

Spring Boot: The Spring Boot framework was employed to facilitate seamless integration between the backend and the database. By utilizing Spring Boot's powerful features and functionalities, the project achieved efficient API integration, enabling smooth data retrieval and manipulation.

Java: Java, a versatile and robust programming language, was utilized for the backend logic of the application. It played a crucial role in implementing the business logic and handling the interactions with the database. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

React/JS/Sass: The frontend of the Online Encyclopedia of Famous Figures was developed using React, JavaScript, and Sass. These technologies were employed to create a dynamic and engaging user interface. React, being a popular JavaScript library, facilitated the rendering of data obtained from the backend API. Numerous components and pages were designed and implemented to provide users with an immersive and user-friendly experience. Asynchronous operations were handled using modern techniques like async/await functions.

--Features--
Database: The project incorporates a MySQL database containing a vast collection of famous figures, each with detailed information, including name, category, images, biography, and dates of birth/death. The database was meticulously designed to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

API Integration: Spring Boot enables seamless integration with the database through well-defined API endpoints. These endpoints allow for querying and filtering data based on user requirements, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

Backend Logic: The Java backend handles the business logic of the application, including data processing, filtering, and retrieval from the database. Spring annotations are extensively used to simplify development, enhance code readability, and ensure adherence to best practices.

Frontend Development: The frontend of the application is built using React, JavaScript, and Sass. React components were modularly designed to enhance reusability and maintainability. Asynchronous operations were efficiently managed using modern JavaScript techniques like async/await, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.
